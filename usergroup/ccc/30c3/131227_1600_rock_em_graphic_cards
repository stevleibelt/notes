# Motivation

* big data
* weather calculation
* molecular simulation

# Parallelism

## Data Parallelism

* Fry omlets for 8000 peoples

## Task Parallelism

* cook a five course menu for one person

# Possible Problems

* kitchen to small
* only apprentices available
* not enough fying pans
* delivery paths to small

* serve the courses on the correct order

# Tools

## OpenMP

## OpenMPI

* matrix multiplication

## CUDA

* nvidia way
* keeps you focused on doing things

## OpenCL

* you have to deal with a lot of the basics to getting started
* gives you more flexibility

## OpenACC

* code will be compiled/converterd into openCL code
* code looks more readable then openCL code
