# Dockerizing PHP Applications

By [Sebastian Heuer](https://sebastianheuer.de/)

* docker is not one tool but a whole [ecosystem](https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/docker_toolbox)
    * machine (provisioning)
    * swarm (clustering and container scheduling)
    * compose (multi container application) 
    * registry (image distribution)
    * engine (the container)
    * ktematic (gui)
* pretty small compared to virtual box/full virtual machines
* updating means, building a new container
* theoretically, you can use all the images from the [hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
    * always ask yourself if you want to use them in production
        * are they maintained
        * how secure are they
* docker compose
    * builds and pulls images
    * runs containers
    * enables networking between containers
    * aggregates STDOUT and STDERR output

## example [Dockerfile](https://github.com/belanur/docker-example/blob/master/meetup-service/Dockerfile)

```
FROM php:7.0.2-fpm

RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo pdo_mysql

COPY php/php.ini /usr/local/etc/php/
# copy the content of the source code into the image
# you can ship this code version now
COPY . /srv/meetup-service

# the date in the container is not persistent
# if ypu change something in it, it will bill lost afterwards

CMD ["php-fpm"]
```

## example [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/belanur/docker-example/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

```
webserver:
  build: ./nginx    #path to the docker file and configuration etc
  links:
    - application
  ports:
    - "80:80"   #from port 80 to port 80
  volumes_from:
    - application
application:
  build: ./meetup-service   #your project
  links:
    - database
  ports:
    - "9000:9000"
  volumes:
    - ./meetup-service:/srv/meetup-service  #mounting local source code into the container
  environment:
    - MYSQL_HOST=database
    - MYSQL_DATABASE=application
    - MYSQL_USER=root
    - MYSQL_PASSWORD=parola
database:
  image: mysql:5.7  #no build path, instead an image is used
  volumes:
    - /var/lib/mysql
  ports:
    - "3306:3306"
  environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=docker
    - MYSQL_DATABASE=app
    
```

# Putting down the leadtime

By [Judith Andresen](http://www.judithandresen.com/)

* what is the leadtime?
    * time between adding the ticket and releasing it as a feature
* what is a cycletime?
    * time between someone has an idea and releaseing it as a feature
* we are currently in a time of digital transformation to the "first mover"
    * first idea try/test is the one who owns the bigges marked share
    * try to not be perfect
    * remove bottlenecks
    * try to scale vertical (microservice, duplicated data)
        * one team and service per business value/topic
            * search (including frontend, backend, customer data etc.)
            * product page
        * "community of practice" is a team (per vertical cut/team) that try
            * to keep the big architecture picture in mind
            * to share knowledge, approach and libraries
    * try to add a decision-maker into the team (extend the team in the value chain)
    * try to bring people together, also on an emotional level (increase the "we" feeling)
    * you can argue always with a decreased leadtime / small time to market
* typical "facts" against
    * we have never done that this way
    * my discipline is better, information silos, no talk between departments (typically between 20 and 80 peoples)
    * there is no "we"
* how?
    * talk to each other
    * major goal: deliver fast
    * create room for improvment or options
        * time
        * people
        * space/room
