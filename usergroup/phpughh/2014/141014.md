## Whats the problem?

* new api in two hours
* do rapid prototyping

## In a nutshell

* create a RESTful web services quick
* create a rpc web service
* supports versioning per url or negotiation (content type)
* returns JSON and HAL JSON out of the box
* authentication (database, code based, other)
* api documentation
* data validation (zend filtering)
* supports deployment
* modular based

## Example

* databased rest service
* see [slides](http://de.slideshare.net/eggertralf/apigility) for steps
* good for easy stuff or [complex stuff](https://github.com/RalfEggert/phpughh-apigility)
* good for rapid prototyping of see how the modules are working

## Pair Programming

### Prefrace

* pair programming illuminated (book)
* specification by examples (book)
* [workshop](https://github.com/DissidentTrainings/workshop-pairprogramming)

### Critics

* two programmers doing the work of one

### Thesis

* working alone, undistrubed is good
* talking is disturbance which is bad

### Theory

* two persons (comes from rally driver)
    * driver (with the keyboard, focused to the current problem)
    * navigator (looking more at the whole concept)
* switching roles regulary

### Why

* less bugs
* faster in development (problem solving)
* continous knowledge exchange
* tightest feedback loop you can get in programming (even unit tests take longer)
* P (plan), D (do), C (check), A (act) - loop
* communication
* simplicity (doing simple things, because two people have to understand)
* feedback
* respect
* courage
* bring back fun into work

### Principles

* feedback
* embracing change (also the guy which code is change would became less grumpy)
* assuming simplicity
* seven synergies
* pair pressure (chance they get interrupted is become lower)
* pair negotiation
* pair courage
* pair review
* pair debugging
* pair learning
* pair t(h)rust


### Seven Habits of Effective Pair Programmers

* take breaks (five minute breaks after 30 minutes)
    * take a look at "[pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)" (5 up to 7 pomodoros is a full day work)
* practice humility
* be confident 
* communicate
* listen
* be a teamplayer
* compromise vs standing firm
* introverts vs extraverts / introversion vs extraversion
* skill
    * shu-beginner (repeat presented action)
    * ha-intermediate (start break the rules/make innovations)
    * ri-expert (do not care about the rules)
    * do "shu" and "shu" - easy up starting into things
    * do "shu" and "ha" - create another master
    * do "shu" and "ri" - kickstart the shu
    * do "ha" and "ha" - biggest bang for the buck
    * do "ha" and "ri" - create another expert
    * do "ri" and "ri" - solve big problems

### Type of Pairs

* everybody pairs with everybody once in a time - good for knowledge sharing
* pair hinging - do a user story together
* test first pairing - implement, make the test red, switch and replay
* stakeholder pairing - explain the stakeholder your code or the flow
* newbie pairing - pair a newbie to a experienced one and finish a user story
* pair bugfixing
* pair release
* write userstories/requirements as pairs
* coding dojos - navigator and driver, audience can give feedback

### To The Critics

* knowledge iceberg (small explicit, tacit is the big part)
* bug fixing cost (small: requirements, design, code, test, productiom :big)
* flow state is established easily 
* groupflow
* teamwork
