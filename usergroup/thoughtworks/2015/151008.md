# How High Performance Organizations Innovate at Scale | Enabling Innovative Culture

```
Try to adapt the technologies we lerned from agile development to the company.
```

## What is Lean?

```
"Precisely *specify value* by specific product,
identify the *value stream* for each product,
make value *flow* without interruptions, let
the customer *pull* value from the producer,
and *pursue perfection*."
```

## What is Enterprise?

```
"A *complex, adaptive system* composed of
people who share a common *purpose*."
```

## What Else?

```
"Right now, your company has
12st century Internet enabled
business processes, mid 20th
century management processes,
all built atop 19th century
management principles."

- Gary Hamel, American Management Expert
```

```
High-performing IT organizations experience 60X fewer failures and recover from failure 168X faster than their lower-performing peers. They also deploy 30X more frequently with 200X shorter lead times.

Lean management and continuous delivery practices create the conditions for delivering value faster, sustainably.

High performance is achievable no matter if your apps are greenfield, brownfield or legacy.

DevOps initiatives launched solely by C-level executives or from the grassroots are less likely to succeed.

IT managers play a critical role in promoting diversity and limiting burnout.

```

## Mind the Gap between Business (CEO, COO, CFO, CMO) and Technology (CIO, CTO, CDO)

```
Technology as strategic capability.
Willingness to support experimentation.
Iterative, adative working processes and practices.
Reduce learning anxiety across organazation.
Ability to innovate at scale.
```

## How to become a Lean Enterprise

### Culture of Experimentation

* we first change our behaviour, than our culture changes
* a manager should not tell the people what work they should do, he helps the people to do they work
* it is not about talent, it is about the system

### The Four Steps of the Improvement Kata Model

* understand the direction or challange
* grasp the current condition
* establish the new target condition
* iterate toward the target condition

### The Three Motivators

* autonomy (how much can I organize my own work)
* mastery (urge to get better at things to became proud)
* purpose (why does a company exist, why am I going to work each day, why is he doing things)

## Organizational Design

```
"The main obstacles to
improve business
responsiveness are slow
decision-making, conflicting
departmental goals and
priorities, risk-averse
cultures and silo-based
information."
```

* we measure developers by how many tikets they do
* we measure testes by how many tests they do
* we measure system performance by their uptime
* old struture named as "command and control"
    * you have to trust your people
    * stop the process madness from "plan -> do" to "plan -> do -> act -> check -> plan -> ..." (at least on roundup per year)
        * what does the customer want?
        * can I deploy it?

```
Adhering to budgeting rules
should not trump good
business goals.
```

## Impact Map

* Who?
* How?
* What?

## What Can I Do Tomorrow

* principle of mission
    * what is the goal the team has to achive
* reduce leaning anxiety
    * start small
    * let people talk with their experiments to others in the company
* create fast feedback cycles
    * define boundaries
    * small features
    * small money

## Notes

* create a culture where people are trying something new
* a change should not mean "you are loosing your job", it should indicate "hey, we want to learn new stuff"
