# The Flip Side of Dependency Injection

## General

* Author of phpab and phpDox
* slides available to [http://talks.thephp.cc](talks.thephp.cc)

## Do Not

* do not add to much dependecies (thing is doing to much)
* do not hide dependencies by using a container (it's like throwing in "the config")

## Do

* all dependencies must be in code
* separate object creation from usage
* there must be the ability to choose the actual implementation on runtime

## How to Get There

* use a [factory](https://github.com/theseer/Factory) with explicite API (instead of "get('Foo')", do "getFoo()")
* avoid injecting factories, try to use locators (locators are returning "FooInterface" and using factories for instance creation)
