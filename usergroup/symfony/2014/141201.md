# the best practices book for symfony 2.5

## general

* introduction by julius
* walktrough the book
* including on demand discussion (??)

## introduction

* guide represents best practices (??)
* you don't to use all the guides
* do not update because you want to be up to date

## create your own (blog) project

* use composer (add link to new/speedup composer release)
* link to laravell (??)
* do not prefix your AppBundle with your name since this is already your application logic you will never share or reuse

## configuration

* infrastructure in parameters.yml
* configuration into config.yml
* use constants to define options that rarely change

## organize your business logic and processes

* use your AppBundle
* as long as you know what you do
* define services, name them shortly and use them
* do not use the parameter in service names, except you know what you are doing
* use annotations to define mapping and just one (doctrine data) fixtures class for simplicity (or more if the class gets quite large)

## controllers

* extend from FrameworkBundle base controller
* use annotations for routing, caching and security whenever possible to use all features out of the box and increase your productivity
* controller should only be seen as a thin controller with a few lines of glue-code
* spending hours trying to decouple them from your framework does not benefit you in the long run
* decouple your business logic from the framework
* do not use @Template() since it is using a TemplateListener (speed goes from 5 ms to 26 ms) and especially you are loosing the overview
* use EventDispatcher for pre and post hooks for your controller (actions)

## templates

* use twig templating format
* store your templates in app/Resources/views/
* define your twig extensions in AppBundle/Twig
* configure them using the app/config/services.yml
* grunt is hard to maintaine
* gulp is lighter and faster
* frontend ressourcen (??) in one bundle

## forms

* define your forms s php classes
* add buttons in the templates not in the form classes or the controllers
* search for a bachelor (??) thesis and webforms (schusseck ??)

## internationalization

* xliff
* po
* into the database
* cache it
* JMSTranslationBundle
* prefix your "ready to translate" (for e.g. with "...") to indicate this needs to be translated
* use catalogs to easy up the key naming
* try to build up a semantic "name spacing" with form label element ids

## security

* use login for main site
* use token system for your api
* use only one firewall entry with anonymous key enabled
* use bcrypt for your passwords
* use access_controll
* use @Security annotation
* use security.contextservice
* if needed, use Symfony ACL

## web assets

* store your assets in the web/
* use tools like gulp or grunt to combine and minimize assets

## tests

* define functional test that at least checks if your application pages are successfully loading
* hardcode thee urls used in the functional tests instead of using the url generator
