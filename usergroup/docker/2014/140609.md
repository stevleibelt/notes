# Introduction Docker

## General 

By [Johannes Ziemke](https://twitter.com/discordianfish)
from [docker](http://www.docker.com/)

## What is Docker

* [version 1.0](http://www.docker.com/) released a few hours ago - api stable (a bit)
* written in go
* build, packs and ships applications as lightweight containers
* build once an run almost everywhere (since kernel 3.8.*)
* rewrite of docCloud PaaS code

## Benefits 

* start always from clean slate
* spawn up complete test infrastructures in seconds
* run your code against multiple versions easily
* easy up setup of software environment
* distribute complex setups as self-contained containers
* build own infrastructure
* easy ups deployment per day
* scaling and mantaining of infrastructure (state convergence, manage everything)
* helps you to solve managing complexity
    * similar problems
        * modules, classes, plugins
        * human communication: named concepts like car, cat or container
        * shipping goods: intermodal containers
    * solution:  create an abstraction
        * does not matter what is in the container nor where it runs
        * clear separation of concerns (reduce communication between developers and ops)
        * developer can take care about used libraries, packagemanager, ...
        * op can take care about the system (alos resource planning and monitoring)
* running commandos on top of:
    * immutable, shipable, layered images (defined by dockerfile, built by builder and pushed/pulled to [registry](http://hub.dockercom))
    * copy-on-write storage on top (provides writeable layer on top of read only images to persists changes done by running container)
        * aufs
        * btrfs
        * devicemapper
    * isolated environment
        * using kernal features
            * namespaces (isolation by scoping, available: pid, mnt, net, uts, jpc, user)
            * cgroups (limit, accound and isolated general devices, cou, memory, ...)
            * future (solaris zones ...)
    * via RESTish API
    * missing pieces
        * docker can not address service discovery or dynamic scheduling
        * projects to close the gap
            * openstack
            * coreOs
            * mesos + marathon
            * flynn.io

## Demotime

* --privileged  -   can break out of container but control host
* images are read only and creating a container on each start
* docker commit <id>    -   creates new image out of running container
* use [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io)

# Continous Delivery with Docker

By [Tobias Schwab](https://twitter.com/tobstarr)
from [Dynport GmbH](http://www.dynport.de/)

## Philosophie

* continous delivery
* canarien releases
* "never touch running system", create a new one when something has to change
* immutable releases (once created, never change it) 

## Why They used Docker

* privacy concerns, aws not an option
* hoster they could not pick
* unreliable API
* flash based structure management
* limited capacity
* they are the biggest customer

## Learnings

* image based deployments -> use dockerfiles (do not add dockerfile generators on top)
* use syslog and rsyslog to log out of the container
* >>CMD ["/sbin/init"]<< to start debian based image
* caching
* configuration management
    * [store configuration in environment](http://12factore.net/config)
    * dependency injected with start of container (use same container for testing, stageing, testing ...)
    * logfiles and data outside of the container
* do not
    * full blown vm (best case, one service per container)
    * ssh deamon inside containers
    * syslog deamon inside containters (sometimes needed)
    * user management (everything can run as root)
    * chef/puppet makes caching useles
    * rely on external services (github, gem page)
* build management tools
    * bundler, pip, carton, composer, ...
    * problem is, they are slow on "clean slate"
    * ways to solve
        * add mainifest (like composer.lock) before code and use cached build files
        * pre-bundles base images
* multi host
    * image distribution via docker registry
    * weighted load balancing via HAProxy
    * SSL termination via HAProxy (container exists by [Johannes Ziemke](https://twitter.com/discordianfish))
* load balancing
    * HAProxy
    * pool configuration stored in redis/etcd
    * configuration update
        * created
        * uploaded via ssh to host
        * verify configuration
        * replace configuration (old with new)
        * reload configuration
* logging
    * putting container id, revision of image (host, code, request) via rsyslog out of the container
* metrics
    * [openTSDB](http://opentsdb.net)
        * distributed, scalable time series database
        * hbase
        * tags/diminsions
        * from syslog via udp
        * rickshaw.js for graphs
        * compare status cudes, counts and times between actions of two revisions
* benefits (reduces)
    * external dependencies
    * "did work on my machine"
    * unused cpu cycles
    * number of hosts
    * feedback times (number of deploys per day)
    * time to get new host online
    * hosts are more flexible
    * controlled revision change (controlled on each host)
    * faster build
