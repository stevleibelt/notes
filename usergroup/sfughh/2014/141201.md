# the [best practices book for symfony 2.5](http://symfony.com/pdf/Symfony_best_practices_2.5.pdf)

## general

* introduction by julius
* walkthrough the book
* including an on demand discussion

## introduction

* guide represents best practices
* you do not need to use all the guides
* do not update to a newer version because you want to be up to date, only do it because of:
    * new features
    * security fixes

## create your own (blog) project

* use composer
* link to [laravel](https://github.com/laravel)
* do not prefix your AppBundle with your name since this is already your application logic and you will never share or reuse this

## configuration

* infrastructure in parameters.yml
* configuration into config.yml
* use constants to define options that rarely change

## organize your business logic and processes

* use your AppBundle
* only create more if you know what you doing
* define services, name them shortly and use them
* do not use the parameter in service names, except you know what you are doing
* use annotations to define mapping and just one (doctrine data) fixtures class for simplicity (or more if the class gets quite large)

## controllers

* extend from FrameworkBundle base controller
* use annotations for routing, caching and security whenever possible to use all features out of the box and increase your productivity
* controller should only be seen as a thin controller with a few lines of glue-code
* spending hours trying to decouple all of your code from your framework does not benefit you in the long run
* decouple your business logic from the framework and thats it
* do not use @Template() since it is using a TemplateListener (speed goes from 5 ms to 26 ms) and especially you are loosing the overview
* use EventDispatcher for pre and post hooks for your controller (actions)

## templates

* use twig templating format
* store your templates in app/Resources/views/
* define your twig extensions in AppBundle/Twig
* configure them using the app/config/services.yml
* grunt is hard to maintaine and getting slow in the long run
* gulp is lighter and faster, try to use this for new projects but do not switch because of the "it is new"-factor
* frontend resources in one bundle to not spread frontend all over the application and other bundles

## forms

* define your forms as php classes
* add buttons in the templates not in the form classes or the controllers to gain reusability
* take a look to [webforms](http://webmozarts.com/) by [Bernhard Schussek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bschussek)

## internationalization

* xliff (worst)
* po (even not that good)
* into the database (best since it decouplse changes from releases)
* cache it
* JMSTranslationBundle
* prefix your "ready to translate" (for e.g. with "...") to indicate this needs to be translated
* use catalogs to easy up the key naming
* try to build up a semantic "name spacing" with form label element ids

## security

* use login for main site
* use token system for your api
* use only one firewall entry with anonymous key enabled
* use bcrypt for your passwords
* use access_control
* use @Security annotation
* use security.contextservice
* if needed, use Symfony ACL

## web assets

* store your assets in the web/
* use tools like gulp or grunt to combine and minimize assets

## tests

* define functional test that at least checks if your application pages are successfully loading
* hardcode the urls used in the functional tests instead of using the url generator
