* ... [if you want to know more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodou)

# Who does vodou in php

* mostly used by junior developers trying to over-abstract
* very few senior developers when building compromise
* don't do it because it will break when the magic breaks

# what tools do we need for magic

* magic methos
* refelction
* closures
* some constructs and functions

# lets start [coding something](https://github.com/Ocramius/voodoo-php/tree/gh-pages/examples)

* manipulate properties by using a friend object
    * useful for mapping data from a to b 
    * library [altr-ego](https://github.com/leedavis81/altr-ego) is usable
* hide properties
    * by using magic `__get($name)`
* AOP (separate cross-cutting concerns, not very different from macros)
    * in php, usually rewrites files before they are evaluated (but after they are autoloaded)
    * library [goaopphp](https://github.com/goaop/framework)

# libraries

* [doctrine/instantiator](https://github.com/doctrine/instantiator) (useful to build serializors)
* [leedavis81/vent](https://github.com/leedavis81/vent)
* [ocramius/lazymap](https://github.com/Ocramius/LazyMap) (like pimple but faster beacause this avoids a lot of function calls)
* [timetoogo/pinq](https://github.com/TimeToogo/Pinq)
* [jeremeamia/super_closure](https://github.com/jeremeamia/super_closure)
* [ocramius/proxy-manager](https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager)
* [roave/strict-php](https://github.com/Roave/StrictPhp) (should run before running your test suites)
