* but 200 euro are still to much, but you can use DVB-T Sticks and raspberry pi
* problems
    * crypto has one big problem which is eavesdroping
        * each one in your nearby can store the data
        * and later decrypt it
    * furthermore, you can localize the transmitter with multiple antennas
    * and even more, you can overlap the signal of the transmitter
    * nfc wormholing
    * wormholing and time traveling (check the slides)
    * reactive jamming (since wifi tries to avoid collision)
    * friendly jamming for confidentiality
    * seeing with wifi (you can see if and where people are located in a room)
    * hearing with wifi
* building wireless security
    * wyner wiretap channel
    * covert channels
    * distance bounding
    * device fingerprinting (but can be faked with software)
    * and there is even more
        * pacemaker with a local jammer (imd shield)
        * and more ...
