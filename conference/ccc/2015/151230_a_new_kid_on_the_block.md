* [talk](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7403.html) by [katharina nocun](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/speakers/6118.html)
* why this talk?
    * do not like facebook
    * but it is used for a lot of communication
    * facebook account, nope, sorry
    * why can't we convince people to use something else
* internet today
    * big net
    * big communication silos
    * no real competition possible which is a big market failure
* why is facebook so popular?
    * facebook as state would have more inhabitants than china, europe and the usa togehter
    * each user is logging in at least once per month
    * user adds context to content
* why is facebook so bad?
    * it is once of the most important gatekeeper of all time (based on secret algorithms)
    * it decides which content, user or group is allowed and which not
    * it struggles with privacy a lot (connection informations or search queries "thanks to" the like button)
    * all the informations you leave why you use this are stored in their database
    * uses proprietary standards and interconnection (which complicates users to switch aka "switching costs" and the "lock-in" effect)
    * even if they start with open standards, they will close it down somewhen in the near future
    * we are not the consumers, we are the product that is sold (and its a gold mine, your profile is worth around eight currency per year while it costs around zero dot something currency per year)
    * they are expanding their borders
        * killed net neutrality in some countries
        * disallowed sharing from other networks by adding the features on their plattform
        * in mind, they are becomming "the internet"
* social networks strengths
    * filter messages
    * find groups
    * exchange ideas, organize stuff
    * a very powerful idea to enhance democracy and freedom of speach
* so what is good about diaspora?
    * starting with a decentralized network with the approach to go to a distributed network
    * the state of diaspora
        * five out of ten pods are located in germany
        * around 40 k users are logging in at least once per month (so it failed to overcome facebook)
* why does diaspora as decentralized structure struggles so hard to overcome facebook?
    * the network effect
        * the global network effect (nice to have)
        * local network effect (which is more important and where facebook came from)
        * and the local network effect is how social networks are growing
        * indirect network effects
            * do not need to pay money to place your "apps"
            * you can benefit from the "add" system easily
* so, what to do now?
    * overcome facebook over night will not really happen
    * even a cool new feature will not change this since facebook will copy this feature pretty quickly
    * keep on promoting the killer features facebook will not copy
        * decentralized network
        * open source
        * privacy
    * new features are comming soon like
        * chat extension which can work with jabber
        * group feature
        * events
    * ask other groups what they need so they would use diaspora
* other networks available (which are part of the federations)
    * diaspora
    * friendica (strong on connecting people)
    * red matrix (strong on privacy)
