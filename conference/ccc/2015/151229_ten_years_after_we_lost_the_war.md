* [talk](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7501.html) by [rop](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/speakers/1572.html) and [frank](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/speakers/1633.html)
* "they" means the people out there who not belive in a democracy world
* democracy is something you have to fight for day in and day out
* the dron war is the start of the robot war
* whe lost the war for the direct way to a positiv disturbia
* this talk is not as depressing as in the first one since you have learned how to live in this currend depressing daylife
* the clima has changed in that way as that the pattern for regions have shifted
* we as current generation will be the generation who fucked up the weather of the planet
* the war of water started already
* and there will be more wars for essential ressources
* we have to take responsibility for the current state
* and stop trusting in the bright future where we just can escape from the fucked up environment
* "breaking things to fixing things" and thats something we have to do on our space ship calle earth
* fight the human rights and manage the migration
* stop countries that put chaos on country ("bombing countries into democracy" is not working anymore on the massmedia, thats why the drone program has been started)
* we still need to update the system we had build to supporting people who are comming "from the dark side" with informations
* the assumption "if the scandal is big enough, the system will correct itself" was totally wrong
* transparancy alone does not work anymore
* if the internet of thing becomse real, there is a censore and surveillance everytime around you (lets make objects cloudless again!)
* so what is our mission as the hacking community?
    * keep the capabilities for political actors who want to change stuff open
    * handle the core struggles between personal privacy and institutional transparancy
* we life in a time of "massivly garbaged and bullshited society"
    * no more discussions
    * usa is know as "the bullshit" mountain in the way of faked lifes
    * it is ok to be angry or depressed for an amount of time, but do not get stuck into it
    * we need to filter between people who are paranoid and the once that have fear by goverment preassure
    * all available political models are corrupted and not better than the other unless we can get out the curruption out of the system
* we came from a time full of liberty, democracy and bright civilization
* the next decades will be not as glory as the past but we do not know about
    * how long this grey time will be
    * how grey this time will be
    * what will come after this greyish time
* we have to be the clowns showing the population how full of black humor our current world is
* furthermore, we have to dream ahead
    * chop the way into pieces
    * and than start working on the first few
    * try this with "funny" strategies
* the stability of the system is gone
    * things can change quickly
    * we can not guarantee that the change is a good one
* complexity is the new norm, simple solutions is gone
* stop trust in the world you should belive into (advertisment, belive into the "happy outcome")
* collect the evidence of the people who are doing bad things and let them know we are collecting them and that we will use this against them when possible
* be positive on a daily level
    * carrying for your friends
    * sharing knowledge
    * do good things day in and day out
* many young people do not have the stable background
    * older people have established a good fundament of income
    * it is harder for younger people where the "fighting" and preassure is much higher
* we are heading towards a rugh time but this should not prevent us from having a funny time (the stronger the storm, the higher the waves)
* we can build tools to support political people fixing shit
* make "developing infrastructure" sexy
