* [talk](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7457.html) by [whitney merrill](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/speakers/5161.html)
* predictive policing criming
    * police officer gets permanent information about his environment
    * he also has microphones and cameras around him which evaluates the data
    * "50 percent a crime will happen" is something he gets as information
* preditcting who and what
    * individual predictions
    * location predictions
    * victim predictions
* generally
    * encourage collection and hoarding of data about crimes and individuals
    * information sharing
        * easier
        * done by third party and departments
* determining guilt and innocence
    * no degree of suspicion
        * can make only prbabilistic predictions
        * about future and the past
* type of data
    * personal characteristics
    * demographic information
    + activities of an individual
    * scientific data
* private partners
    * hitachi visualization predictive crime analytics
    * hunchlab
    * domain awareness system (NYC and Microsoft)
    * IBM SPSS Crime Prediction and Prevention
    * chicago heat list (420 individual names)
    * precob (used in germany, switzerland - also in hamburg)
* united states of america law
    * suspicion is based on the totality of the circumstances (the whole picture)
    * balanced assessment of the relative weights
    * specific and articulable facts
    * based on experience and common sense
* uk law
    * somehow similar to the united states of america law
* is this somehow like a black box where information goes in and suspicion is comming out?
    * an algorithm can not predict this perfectly
    * must fit to a current action the person is doing
    * can not process all data in real time
    * algorithm needs to be updated
* problems
    * bad and wrong underlying data
    * noise in training data
    * inhomogeneous data per community
    * database errors
    * human errors
