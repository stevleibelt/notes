* mistake I made
    * no release anything (even small things)
    * try to seek consensus with everyone
* what I learned
    * independent vs. corparated contributions
        * wanted to fix problems quick (so even small releases are good)
    * package maintainers in os distributions
    * trolls on the internet
    * github inc.
    * myself
        * I want to try things to well
