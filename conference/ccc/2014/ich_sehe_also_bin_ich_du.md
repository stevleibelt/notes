# how to get a finger print

## past

* use colored powder (not very stable)
* use superglue (more stable but also not that easy to use)
* amino acid indicator

## now

* finger print
    * any mobilephone app with access to the camera/s (resolution with fitting light and environment)
    * frontend camera with high resolution for using reflection of the eye or the iris
        * fetching position of the finger while entering a password or pin
        * it is even better when person is using a sun glass
    * by using a standard camera, you can use a foto made by a distance up to three meter
    * using infrared again increases the distance up to six and a half meter
* eyes
    * currently, you only need a 1200 dpi face printout to unlook exisiting high end iris security systems
    * using infrared camaras while getting the iris (working for a distance up to six and a half meter)
    * getting iris of politicans? simple use high resolution election posters
* face detection
    * secured by movement
    * simple use foto and make a movement with an object like a pen
* vein
    * currently only doable in laboratory conditions

## future

* new / upcomming camaras can adjust the focus after the picture was taken
