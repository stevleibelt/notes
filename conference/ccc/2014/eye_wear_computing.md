# personal information

* wearable computing
* recognizing human activities with sensors
* getting more and more interested whats going on in our mind

# why is eye war computing useful

* eyes are the perfect door to the mind
* a lot of work in psychology and cognitive since is used for advertisment (which is sad)
    * he can already figure out what kind of book you are reading
    * how well you are understanding this
    * how many words you are reading per hour/day/...
    * would like to focus on concentration
    * blink detection and activity recognition on google glass by using the [infrared sensor](https://github.com/shoya140/GlassLogger)

# future ideas

* recognizing talking since blink frequency doubles if you are talking
* tiredness detection
* distinguishing closely related activities by blink frequencies (reading, watching ...)
* J!NS MEME (eye is a dipole so simple measure the eye potential or the muscle movement when you blink)
* tracking cognitive load / brain activation sensing (with NIRS - near-infrared spectroscopy estimating)
* use cheap eye tracking device to prevent learning persons from the frustration level

# in summary

* previous centuries - faster, higher, more
* current centuries - overvome our physical limitation
* upcomming centuries - overcome our cognitive limitation
