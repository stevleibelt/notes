# what does it mean when chelsea is transgender and wants to get medical treatment (by Chase Strangio)

* even while this is a general accepted disease, the military just ignored this
* the military even knowed this fact three years before she leaked the documents
* the military allowed her to grow their hair and arrange her room

* chelsea asked for medical help as often as possible
* she wants to be recognized as a woman, everywhere and everytime

# what is the use of the political act of espionage procsecutions (by Ahmed Chappour and Nancy Hollander)

* the espionage act is to punish folks for spying for the enemies
* it was written in world war one
* it was a bad law as it began ant it is a worst law now
* it is not as bad as you read it but as the court interpret it
* it is commited when the act of disclosure can be seen and it does not matter in what way this affects the world since the national can decide if this information is national security dependend or no
* five persons in guantanamo where presented as "they could never be released since they are holding information that would danger the use, and nothing happens after they where released years ago)
* so the law can be used "as whished"
* in general, the nation is using this law to criminalize each whistleblower
* obama creates an insider threat (and puts preasue even on journalist)

# what kind of recourse does chelsea has

* she is arrested for 35 years
* currently, the main focus is on her appeal
* it is the longest transcript in the us military history (with classified content)
* in general, we try to show the judge that chelsea had no real trial

* military decides which witness are valid and not
* so the list of issues happend is very long

# whats about the [computer fraud and abuse act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act)
