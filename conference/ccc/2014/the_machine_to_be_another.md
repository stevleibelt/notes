* what would the world be if we could see the eye through someone else
* identity and empathy

# why

* rubber hand experiment (something is acting on a rubber hand looking like your hand and you feel it while you see it with your eyes but it is not happening in your hand)
* putting yourself the skin of a black avatar reduces the bias of racism

# current state

* first person - head mounted display
* second person - first person camera
* this technology puts you into a space where you are not your own but also not fully the other person
* after being your own again, you get a feeling and enrich empathy to the other person you have been for a while
* if you are doing movement, your body has to be in sync with what you are doing (which increase the relationship between the two persons doing the movement)
