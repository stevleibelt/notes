* animals as bombs
* cyborg drones today

# animals as messengers and spies

## homing pigeons

* domestic pigeons
* fly very fast
* they fly home

# animals as messengers and spies

## world war one

* radio and wired communication was still crude and unreliable
* pigeons were kept behind the front line and taken into battle in wicker baskets
* around 95 percent of messeges whre delivered
* even in world war two, united kingdom used about 250000 pigeons
* they were also captured as thropies of war

# animals as bombs

## world war two

* pigeons where still used
* especially after japanes attack on pearl harbour, usa tried to use animals as bombs
* use bat bombs to attack wooden/paper houses (with mixed results since you can not control them)
* anti-tank dogs (by the sowjet union) with bombs to run under german tanks and explode (with really bad results)
* cat bombs (drops near a ship in the water but was not a success ;-))

# cyborg drones today

* attach an electronic device to moths after they where born to remote control them (neural interface)
* even in 2014, the cia's pigeon missions are still classified - they are still working on it?
* it is expected that biobots are real in 2017 or 2022
* ethical question, is it ok to use animals as drones and where is the limit?
