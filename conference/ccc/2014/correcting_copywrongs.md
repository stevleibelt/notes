# worst of both worlds

* no fair use exception
* intransparent (only harmonice the rights for the stakeholders, not for the public)
* since the system is so complicated, companies as well as normal people are violating a lot of copy rights

# eu madness at work

* freedom of panorama (most eu countries don't have this exception)
* legal uncertainty parody (parody is not clear defined in eu countries)
* copyright terms (only a minimum length is defined)
* the 20th century black hole (lots of products are not really know but it is known there is a copyright on it)
* how to determine copyright terms  (it is difficult to go trough the decision tree)
* copyright on official works (in general, public licence does not create financial benefits)
* copyright as a censorship tool
* criminalising pop culture (e.g. on a reaction gifs)
* we stopped acta
* public consultation on copyright
* copywrongs.eu where started

# shifting the focus

* replace 28 copyright system with one european copyright
* stop infinite copyright
* no more drm
* remix culture (shift from "read only" to "read and write")
* Ã¶ttinger - the right man for the job?
* the lobby is not on our side
* the german conspiracy
* lobby meetins requests
    * users
    * publishers and cmos
    * providers
    * authorities
    * authors
# future

* typical brussls compromise
    * maybe apply a few patches here and there but not fix the structural bugs

# what you can do

* push this issue into the public dabate
* simple put the problem to the street won't work anymore

# the fifth freedom

* based on the eu "four freedoms"
