## perl

* coding style sucks
* the oop sucks
* data types sucks
* to much security people using it
* perl is worse than python because people wanted it worse

# data types

* scalars just regular scalars
* arrays as expected
* dictonaries as expected
* lists behaves ... well
    * beacuse list is not a data types

# cgi

* core module up tp perl 5.2
* used to access http parameters
* has been there for 15 years
* most perl web applications use it

# list abuse

* list get automatically expanded
* "=>" is justa pretty ","

# recap

* lists are dangerous for your health
* git parameters can become lists
* lists in hashes expands the hash

# bugzilla

* some privileges are given via email regex
* new users email gets validated
* post validation the user asked for a password and a real name

# dbi

* core module
* the typical database handler
* built in sql filtering/escaping function called DBI->quote()
* showed sql injection
