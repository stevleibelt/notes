# [2014-12-29 Robert Verch, Eva Olivin](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/events/6124.html)

* robert and eva are comming from the "context based art" scene
* they showed a video what they thought would be a typical robot based video
* someone (called lars) had the opportunity to rent a flat
    * the flat is an not inhabit flat but equipment
    * the last residental just left the flat (20 years ago)
    * so lars told this in his environment, how to use this scenario for an art play
    * "what would be the reason to leave a flat in this state"
    * how to use this flat without adding to much collateral damage (so, lets use a drone)
    * so they decided to use a mars robot and let the flat closed
    * with the [chaos treff chemnitz](https://www.chaoschemnitz.de/Hauptseite), they modified a "panzer roboter" to a remote robot with camera

# they created a game

* they build up a controller station
* while controlling the robot, you have to answere the question "what could happen, that someone leaves his flat that way"
* they did no advertisment, simple sticked one paper with the some keyfacts and the question in the staircase
* in general, the people are adding more comments to the technical details instead of the atmosphere itself
* people are telling that they are acting more rough by using the robot as intermediary technology
* afterwards, they created an exposition with some 360 degrees photos before and after the robotic investigation
* the observers could add some comments in the pictures
