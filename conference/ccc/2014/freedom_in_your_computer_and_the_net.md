* libre not gratis
* try to use your native language if you have another word for free that does not indicate it is gratis (e.g. libre or frei)

# what is a computer

* you give him instructions and the computer is running it
* you or somebody else is giving the instructions to your computer
* in closed software, somebody else requests are solved before your requests (user sharing)

# critierias for free software

* the users control the program
    * a non free software is a yoke
* four freedoms
    * run program as you wish
    * change the program and study the source code to adapt it to your needs
        * program has to be shipped with the source code
        * a group of users should have the possibility to 
    * redistribute the program (and get paid if you wish)
    * redistribute your modified program (and get paid if you wish)

# what happens if the program controlls the user

* unjust power
* most non free programs are maleware
* the difference between free and non-free software is how it is distributed (it is NOT a technical distinction but a social and political one)
* develop free software is a contribute to the society
* a free software is better than nothing, a proprietor is worse than nothing
* a maleware is designed to hurt the users (as spying like kindle, applie's i-software, blue ray, skype that looks like it is closed)
* the terme "jail breaking" is fitting perfectly since it breaks the jail the user is in it

# why they are shipping malware

* because of profit
* the proprietary software is a swindle
* it is a world where ethic is removed

# where can you escape

* the place to escape is the [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html) operation system (like [parabola](https://www.parabola.nu/))
* try to search for GNU/distros to have a complete freedom
* free software is the fundamental basis for security (non free software is blind faith)

# where is non free software on the net?

* non free javascript running in your browser
* service as a software subsitute where you lose control of your important data (input data -> calculate / process -> result) so it is like working with a software containing a universal backdoor

# we have to fight back

* try to organize a protest if companies like adobe or apple are comming into your university to recrute people
* face the obstacles
    * non free software has money and power
    * mass medias are calling it open source software (and not free software, meaning they totally removed the important ethical part)
    * "we demand feedom" (free software activists) is not "we would like better quality" (open source boosters)
    * create free hardware plans
    * teach and use reverse engineering
    * teach freedom in school

# what can you do?

* write free software
* organize usergroups to fight for free software
* say "free software"
* stop governments to collect data to find the whistleblowers
* read the [philosophy](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/)
* read the [license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/)
* try to [help](http://www.gnu.org/help)
