# general

* tor wants to promote "being excellent to each others"
* there is a press alias now "press@torproject.org"
* no backdoors ever
* number of relays and bandwith increases (as usual :-))
* deterministic builds available for tor browser
* made a partnership with mozilla (with "privacy by design" in focus)
* pluggable transports (connecting trough a cdn with tor)
* tor unit tests and refactoring to robust the tested code over the past years
* ooni: open observatory of network interference (curl https://ooni.torproject.org/install.sh | bash)
* tor weekly news
* tor on campus (powered by eff)
* [metrics](https://metrics.torproject.org) is available (spike is a good indicator that censorship is implemented)
* implemented a attack monitoring in tor
* traffic correlation  attacks is a real problem (but currently more a research way)
* its better to get detected as tor user than that anyone sees all your data flow (pervasive surveillance)
* the internet is more centralized as we think (in big data centers around the world)
